This project was inspired by games like Vampire Survivors and drew heavily
from that genre. It was developed as part of my bachelorâ€™s thesis, which
focused on implementing flow field pathfinding in a similar game style.
The game includes genre-specific elements such as a plethora of enemies, a
variety of combinable weapons, and a structured leveling system. Although
the primary aim was research rather than gameplay, I personally designed
all assets and systems. In retrospect, this approach might not have been
the most suitable for a scientific study, but it provided a substantial
learning experience.
