Adventure Island was my first academic group project, involving a team of
around 20 people. The game focused on solving puzzles across islands
themed after the four seasons. I collaborated with three others on the
“summer” island, where we implemented two small puzzles requiring players
to explore the area. Since roles weren’t formally assigned, I contributed
to various aspects of the project, including 3D modeling and coding. This
experience showcased our foundational skills at the time and provided
valuable insights into teamwork and game development in a larger group
setting.
