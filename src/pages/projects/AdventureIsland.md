Adventure Island was my first academic group project, involving a team of around 20 people. The game focused on solving puzzles across islands themed after the four seasons. I collaborated with three others on the “summer” island, where we implemented two small puzzles requiring players to explore the area. Since roles weren’t formally assigned, I contributed to various aspects of the project, including 3D modeling and coding. This experience showcased our foundational skills at the time and provided valuable insights into teamwork and game development in a larger group setting.
