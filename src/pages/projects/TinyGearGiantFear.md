This game was created for Puls Game Jam 2025 in a group of four within 72 hours. The theme for this jam was "kaputt". You play a tiny robot that is actively falling apart and have to manage your health while fleeing from a giant robot that wants to destroy you. The goal is to reach the end of the track without getting scrapped. To achieve this, the player has different abilities to their disposal which can be used according to their respective cooldowns.

I was responsible for most of the coding done in this project ranging from the level generation to the player movement and ability logic. I also worked on particle effects as well as the rendering part. Creating a finished product within such a short time frame is never easy but it gets better with experience. This was one of the first jams that I would consider more or less successful, having a playable game, that looks and feels decent enough and got a relatively good rating.
