Towards the end of my studies, I collaborated with three peers on a group
project to develop a game that fused elements of Doodle Jump and Super
Smash Bros. In this multiplayer game, up to four players compete to scale
a mountain by jumping on procedurally generated platforms, leveraging
unique character abilities to outmaneuver opponents. My primary
responsibility was designing the procedural algorithm for platform
placement, ensuring each platform was accessible while maintaining a
varied and interesting level design. Additionally, I contributed to
creating the voxel-based background and debugging character abilities.
