In this game, players ascend a tower as a spherical drone capable of
clinging to walls and utilizing latent energy to leap in any direction
while navigating obstacles and various challenges.

I developed multiple gameplay elements, progressively enhancing their complexity to demand more precise jumps, tighter timing, and combinations of challenges. This was my first major project outside of university coursework, intended as a platform to apply and test my knowledge in software architecture. I began with simple gameplay concepts, which allowed for flexible experimentation and ideation. However, this openness initially led to some feature creep, which slightly slowed down development.

I created all the assets and code independently, using only royalty-free music from an online pack. Experimenting with custom shaders was particularly enjoyable. While I could have saved time by using existing Unity assets, I prefer these projects as opportunities for learning and experience.
